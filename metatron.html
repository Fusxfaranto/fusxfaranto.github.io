    <h1>Metatron Keyboard</h1>
    <p>
      I decided I wanted a portable ergonomic keyboard (in particular, one making good use of thumb keys). I was trying to decide between a few different options, but there was nothing quite like what I wanted, so I decided to make my own!

      Here are some pictures of the build process:

    <h3>Laser cut plates</h3>

      I designed these in AutoCAD, and had them cut by <a href="http://ponoko.com">Ponoko</a>.

    <h3>Cementing the pieces together</h3>
    <p>

      I elected to use an acrylic cement to attach the pieces instead of using screws, since I wanted to be able to make the wall as thin as possible.  This was a very tense process, since I didn't have any spare pieces if I messed up. You can see a little bit of the prototype breadboard setup on the top right of the picture, which I forgot to take any pictures of...

    <h3>Finished cementing</h3>

    <h3>Switches inserted</h3>
    <p>

      I used Cherry MX Black switches for the thumb switches, and Cherry MX Brown switches for all the other keys.  I had a few issues fitting the switches in, and had to file most of the holes a little bit, but it worked out.

    <h3>Keys soldered and screen in place</h3>
    <p>

    <h3>Everything else soldered in</h3>

    <h3>The final product</h3>

      It does indeed work!  The firmware (<a href="https://github.com/Fusxfaranto/metatron-firmware/">available here</a>) is still a work-in-progress, but I can type with it over both USB and Bluetooth.
